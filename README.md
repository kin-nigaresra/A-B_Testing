# A/B Testing and Hypothesis 
Facebook recently made an offer called maximum bidding.
A new bid type, average bidding, as an alternative to the bidding type introduced.
In this study we want to test this new feature.
We'll do an A/B test to see if this average bid is better than the maximum bid, converting more than we'd like.
There are two groups, the control group and the test group.
